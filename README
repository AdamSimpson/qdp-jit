This implementation has been developed under gcc-3.2.
It is known (for simple reasons) not to compile under
gcc-2.X . The problem parts could easily be changed,
but I can't be bothered at the moment.

It has also been compiled under IBM xlC (version 5 I believe)
and under Intel icc (70) compiler.

However, gcc-2.X is not compliant with the final
version of C++-3 standard on I/O. In particular, stream
support is not all in the correct place with correct
names. That is more annoying to try and backward support
so it won't be supported.
