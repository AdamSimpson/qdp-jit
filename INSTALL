General remarks and requirements:
--------------------------------

 - C++ compiler with C++11 support (GCC 4.8.2 known to work)

 - CUDA 5.5 or higher (which includes libdevice, CUDA 7/8 known to work)

 - GPUs with compute capability 2.0 (or higher, tested on 20, 35, 50)

 - LLVM (4.0.0/4.0.1 known to work)

 - libdevice included with CUDA7/8 are buggy for double precision -> requires patching (patch_libdevice.sh)
   NVIDIA notified, expect clean version from CUDA 9 on

 - 0) patch libdevice, 1) pack libdevice, 2) build
