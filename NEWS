	Version 1.4.4: added flush() to the Text, Nml, Binary writer classes.

06/07/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.3: added QIO support under new(er) MPICH. Changed ifstream/ofstream
        into  qdp_io.cc  to now use a generic RemoteFile{Input,Output}{Buf,Stream}
        for stream'ed files. This gives hooks for manipulating files.

06/05/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.2: small tweaks. Added is_open(), fail() to IO classes.

06/05/2003 -- Robert Edwards

06/04/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.4.0. Overhauled IO classes (except QIO) to use C++
	streams instead of C FILE buffers. Currently, DIME still uses
        C-FILEs since it is written in C.

05/23/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.3 turned on QDP namespace. Moved bfread/bfwrite off to their
        own namespace.

05/23/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.2 changed read_t/write_t to read/write in qdp_qdpio.h . Global
        function variants wrap over member functions.

05/22/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.3.1 tweaked qdp_primvector.h in localInnerProduct to make intel compiler
        happy.

05/22/2003 -- Robert Edwards

        support.

05/10/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.5 minor maintenance update.

04/30/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.4 removed readSzin and readSzinQprop. Changed all occurances
        of char* to using string - except for C-like error exit routines.

04/26/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.3 fixed some small problems in parallel version of NmlReader.

04/25/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.2 more complex namelist reading support.

04/23/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.1 added push/pop to NmlReader/Writer members. Keep
        a push/pop count. Improved regexp for reals in NmlReader.

        Removed check of various std-headers in qio & c-dime. Causing
        problems with malloc on IBM's.

04/21/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.2.0 now have support for namelist reading and QIO. Still missing
        XML metadata.

04/14/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.9 added (but not using) new packages in other_libs/ nml, qio.

04/09/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.8 replaced Layout::subgridVol with Layout::sitesOnNode.

04/09/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.7 added preprocessor control over precision.

04/08/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.6 added Layout::sitesOnNode (as in manual). Changed
        innerproduct to innerProduct. 

04/02/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.5 added preprocessor test of g++ to require V3.0 or greater.

04/02/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.4 moved proto.h to qdp_util.h .

04/02/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.3 fixed usage of QDPSubType (e.g.,subsets) in poke routines

02/27/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.0 added colorContract for color matrices and vectors. 

02/16/2003 -- Robert Edwards

        Version 1.0.0 considered ready. The arch  "scalar" and "parscalar"
	are considered working.

02/10/2003 -- George Fleming:

        Totally reworked the way QDP gets information about how to compile
        and link against QMP (if needed for parscalar).  INSTALL and README
        now are wrong and I need to update them.

01/29/2003 -- Robert Edwards:

        The single box (scalar) and parallel (parscalar) versions
        work. The old compile-time volume configuration removed. The
        user can now choose at run-time the lattice size.


12/13/2002 -- Balint Joo: 

	Switched to George Fleming style autoconf system (See INSTALL)
	examples now not automatically built (make check builds them)

	Added Robert's parscalar_specific.h of 12/12/2002
	Parscalar targets now compile

	Added QDP::QDP_init() and QDP_finalize() to call QMP_init_msg_passing 
	from, with command line arguments
