	Version 1.1.5 added preprocessor test of g++ to require V3.0 or greater.

04/02/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.4 moved proto.h to qdp_util.h .

04/02/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.3 fixed usage of QDPSubType (e.g.,subsets) in poke routines

02/27/2003 -- Robert Edwards

	Version 1.1.0 added colorContract for color matrices and vectors. 

02/16/2003 -- Robert Edwards

        Version 1.0.0 considered ready. The arch  "scalar" and "parscalar"
	are considered working.

02/10/2003 -- George Fleming:

        Totally reworked the way QDP gets information about how to compile
        and link against QMP (if needed for parscalar).  INSTALL and README
        now are wrong and I need to update them.

01/29/2003 -- Robert Edwards:

        The single box (scalar) and parallel (parscalar) versions
        work. The old compile-time volume configuration removed. The
        user can now choose at run-time the lattice size.


12/13/2002 -- Balint Joo: 

	Switched to George Fleming style autoconf system (See INSTALL)
	examples now not automatically built (make check builds them)

	Added Robert's parscalar_specific.h of 12/12/2002
	Parscalar targets now compile

	Added QDP::QDP_init() and QDP_finalize() to call QMP_init_msg_passing 
	from, with command line arguments
